    <h1>About me</h1>
    <img src="images/profile_picture.jpg" alt="Image of me">
    <h2>My name is Salma Maldonado Ocampo</h2>
    <p> I like my name very much, so I always go by Salma, and everyone calls me that way. I am from a place called Chilpancingo in Mexico, which is in the south of the country, but I currently live in the north, in the city of Monterrey. 
        I am married to a wonderful man who loves God and loves me. We are expecting our first child, and we are very grateful and very happy with this opportunity to be parents.
        I love to exercise, spend time with my family, read, and cook, especially any kind of dessert. 
    <p>I am a chemical engineer, and I like very much everything that has to do with participating in industry problem-solving or groups that support projects, which was the main reason I wanted to study engineering. I decided to take BYU Pathway courses because I thought it was a great way to keep up with my academic preparation, and I chose computer programming because I think it goes hand in hand with the development of new ways of improving in any industry.</p>
        Thank you, that is all about me!</p>
